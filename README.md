# Vanilla To-Do App
A simple, yet powerful, to-do app made with vanilla JavaScript. The app is designed to provide an experience, with an emphasis on simplicity and performance.

The App doesn´t aim to be perfect, flawless or best-quality code. It was just an exercise to improve my vanilla JavaScropt skills, after using frameworks for a long time.

## Features
* User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation
* Create and manage multiple tasks
* Add and delete tasks with ease
* Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
* Filter tasks by tags
* Save data locally for offline access

## Why Vanilla JavaScript?
Developing this app with vanilla JavaScript was a great opportunity to exercise your skills and improve your understanding of the language. By avoiding the use of frameworks and libraries, you were able to get closer to the underlying code and understand how everything works.

## What's Next?
It´s possible that you can continue to improve your skills by adding new features, optimizing the code, or exploring other areas of web development. The possibilities are endless! Here are some examples:
* Implement drag-and-drop functionality
* Implement a Responsive Design
