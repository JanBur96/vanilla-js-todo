# Vanilla Todo
## Description
This project is a vanilla JavaScript implementation of a todo list with some extra functionality. The goal of this project is to sharpen my vanilla JavaScript skill after using Frameworks for a long time.

It´s definitely not perfect but I had a lot of fun and I was also able to sharpen my skills. 
You may find some over-engineered stuff or strange things here, since it´s also a bit like a playground where I tested some concepts, etc.
