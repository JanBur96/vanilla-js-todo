# Vanilla Todo

## Description

This project is a vanilla JavaScript implementation of a to-do list with some extra functionality. The goal of this project is to sharpen my vanilla JavaScript skill after using Frameworks for a long time.

The code quality, time complexity, and so on won't be top-notch, since this is just an exercise.
