# Vanilla Todo
## Description
This project is a vanilla JavaScript implementation of a todo list with some extra functionality. The goal of this project is to sharpen my vanilla JavaScript skill after using Frameworks for a long time.

ItÂ´s definitely not perfect but I had a lot of fun and I was also able to sharpen my skills.
